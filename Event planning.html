<p> An event planner picks out where the tournament is being held at , they make sure all the players are active and have somewhere to stay at for that event. Event planners have to call around to make sure that the hotel has a certain amount of rooms available and also can make a gaming room for the players to practice in. Event planners also make a schedule for the whole event that the players and staff have to follow.  An event planner makes over 50k a year. </p>
