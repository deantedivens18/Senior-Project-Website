    <p>    African Americans don’t pursue a career in esport n gaming because of PC, a lot African American don’t like to (Nelius, 2019) play on pc. Which makes sense but you can play on a regular console too and if you don’t like the keyboard you can use your controller just plug it up to the monitor. African Amercians also feel discouraged from other websites or when you type in esports n gaming it just shows white people.The number of black people pursuing a career in esports has been going up not by much but just a little bit. </p>
